# About Forge Clicker
**_Still in Development_** (**_SD_**) : Forge Clicker is a clicker game where the User will click on an object to accumulate an amount of currency to establish an automated currency to keep stacking the currency, in this case **Sparks**. 
- The object the user will click on is known as the **anvil**.
- Sparks are used to forge weapons such as swords and axes, and to potentially forge armour (**_SD_**).
- Once the User forge a certain amount of items, there will be a shop where the User can sell their items to produce or gain money. 
- The money will be used to generate automated items, such as auto hammers (**_SD_**).
